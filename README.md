# Vinland Saga

A platform where chefs can create and share recipes, and connect with each other. 🧑‍🍳

## Process and Goal 💪 🚀

Designed it in Figma 🖌️

The goal was to build something with NextJS and Firebase, and practice what I had learned from the NextJS course from Fireship.

## Installation 🛠️

You just gotta install with `npm` after cloning it 🤘 🎧

Environment variables are also required, which you can get after having created a project on Firebase.
